                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I started collecting a <a href="https://github.com/interferenc/breweries">list of best practices</a> to spread the word on how to build robust SPAs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I advocate for the use of the <b>CLEAN architecture</b> and go against the common practice of just stuffing all business logic into framework-specific components.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I demonstrate how strict types and advanced techniques like discriminated unions and branded types can help to catch possible problems at compile time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I demonstrate how immutability and <b>functional programming concepts</b> can help any SPA get closer to the ultimate goal of never having a runtime exception.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I disassembled the BIOS of an x299 motherboard to find the assembly code that locked the Ex02 model-specific register. I provided a <a href="https://gist.github.com/interferenc/d82357a13751bc24dcc5942f6af2374b">binary patch</a> to the community that disables the lock, allowing the installation of macOS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have uncovered a bug present in all x299 processors, where they all start with skewed time stamp counters (TSC) and built a <a href="https://github.com/interferenc/TSCAdjustReset">kernel extension</a> that resets them on boot and wake, allowing macOS to boot and to use proper power management.
